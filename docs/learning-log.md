**Date:** 10/26/2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create new a new repository
- How to create new folders
- How Issues help teams collaborate
- Why documentation matters in open source projects

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the issues I faced was learning the GITHub interface, it was new to me but I overcame them by follwing the assignment instructions. Another issue I faced was learnimng how to create a new folder in my repositotory and I overcame that by again, following the assigment instructions.

## Connection to My GIS Career

Github will help me in my career by providing me a portfolio to eventually help with my GISP certification. It is also going to help me in my career by teaching me stronger collaboration skills on open source software.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
